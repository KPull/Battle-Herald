Battle Herald
=============

This is a World of Warcraft addon I had written up back in 2013. It worked for Mists of Pandaria but I doubt it works anymore now. Below, I've attached the addon's details page as it appeared on WoWInterface.com.

Enjoy! ;)

------------------------

*Battle Herald* provides features to enhance your battleground/PvP experience!

* Battle Herald provides *a vocal announcer, with professional voice-overs,* for important events as they occur in Battlegrounds and World PvP zones.
* In addition to this, Battle Herald adds *colourful, animated text alerts* in the middle of the screen to help you react much more quicker to whatever happens in the battle. This also replaces the standard text pops in Arathi Basin and The Battle for Gilneas which were not very clear.
* It replaces the standard battleground status text at the top of the screen with more *visible and meaningful heads-up displays* for select battlegrounds (ie. Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley, Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm, Isle of Conquest, The Battle for Gilneas and Twin Peaks).
* In Capture the Flag maps, mousing over the flag icons displays the name of the flag carrier.


All this can be configured through the Interface Options menu (select Addons and open the Battle Heralds list) which lets you select which alerts you would like to receive as well as set the size of the Battleground info UI. You can unlock/lock the position of the Battleground UI by typing in */bh toggleui* and reset its position again with */bh resetui*.

*Get Battle Herald and start owning your opponents in battlegrounds!*
